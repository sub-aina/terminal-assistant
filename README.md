# Terminal Assistant 

> **status: discontinued** (it was fun while it lasted)

been working on this AI-powered terminal thing for a while. never really finished it, but figured i'd document what happened.

basically wanted to make the terminal smarter ,get AI completions as you type, explain random commands you don't understand, all running locally so your data stays put.

## what it was supposed to do

**smart terminal completions**
```bash
$ git pu[TAB]
$ git push origin main  # ‚Üê AI suggests this
```

**explain literally any command**
```bash
$ curl "localhost:8000/explain?cmd=docker%20run%20-it%20ubuntu"
```

**multiple ways to use it:**
- bash completion in your terminal (actually worked!)
- VS code extension for inline suggestions (total failure)
- simple API you can curl (worked fine)

## the setup

pretty standard stuff:
- **backend**: fastapi + python (talks to ollama)
- **AI**: mistral via ollama (runs locally, no openai needed)
- **terminal**: bash completion script
- **vscode**: typescript extension
- **caching**: json files (because why overcomplicate)

```
your terminal ‚Üê‚Üí fastapi ‚Üê‚Üí ollama/mistral
     ‚Üë
  vs code extension
```

## how to run it (if you're curious)

1. **get ollama running**
   ```bash
   ollama pull mistral
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app:app --port 8000
   ```

3. **bash completion** (this part actually worked)
   ```bash
   # add this to ~/.bashrc
   source /path/to/terminal_assistant_completion.bash
   ```

4. **vscode extension** (this part never worked properly)
   ```bash
   cd terminal-assistant
   npm install
   npm run compile
   #  it compiles but doesn't actually work
   ```

## why it didn't work out

honestly? too many issues:

** too slow** ‚Äî even local AI takes like 1-2 seconds. terminal users expect instant feedback. waiting for completions while typing feels broken.

** accuracy sucked** ‚Äî AI would suggest weird completions that made no sense. like suggesting `git push --force` when you typed `git s`. not helpful.

** overcomplicated** ‚Äî bash scripting + fastapi + ollama + vscode extension (that never worked) + caching... too many moving parts for something that should feel simple.

** resource hungry** ‚Äî mistral eating CPU constantly just to suggest `ls -la` seemed overkill.

** deployment hell** ‚Äî getting all the pieces to work together on different machines was a nightmare.

## what actually worked

- the explanation API was solid (`/explain` endpoint)
- command completion worked fine (`/complete` endpoint)
- bash integration was surprisingly smooth
- caching helped with repeated commands
- local AI was cool in theory

## what didn't work

- vscode extension was a complete disaster
- couldn't get inline completions to trigger properly
- extension api was way harder than expected

## things i learned

- real-time AI needs to be *really* fast (sub-100ms)
- terminal users are impatient (fair enough)
- sometimes simpler is better
- bash completion is harder than it looks
- ollama is pretty neat for local AI stuff

most of it works, just not well enough to be useful day-to-day.
